					<description><![CDATA[In this post I explain, how I used JavaScript to extend Piskel with a helpful feature.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently started using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.piskelapp.com/" target="_blank">Piskel</a> more often, which is a cool web app to create cute pixel graphics and animations. It&#8217;s pretty nice to use, but there was a thing I was bothering me. The color picker tool only works in scope of the app. But I wanted to transfer colors from my Affinity project to the Piskel browser app.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed alignwide is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="How I made Piskel to use the native input color control" width="750" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_plfYNt8gJs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><figcaption>My goal was to be able to do this</figcaption></figure>



<p>For each color had to pick the color inside of Affinity Designer, copy the hex code, open the color dialog on Piskel, paste the code and press enter. If you want to transfer a lot of colors, this can get a little bit annoying. </p>



<p>The good thing: Piskel is an Open Source web project. That means with a little effort I could solve this problem for me. Because I know, there is a native color control which has a picker which works across the whole screen (atleast in Chromium browsers): <code>&lt;input type="color"&gt;</code> </p>



<iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/s76gmfua/6/embedded/result,html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allowpaymentrequest="" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<p>Great. Now I needed to bring this to the Piskel application and make it overwrite the current color. I tried to find some kind of a state in the JavaScript code I could use. Because Piskel&#8217;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/piskelapp/piskel" target="_blank">source code is on GitHub</a>, I could just clone the project to my machine and search through the code. Because I know from the User Interface that the main color is called &#8220;primary color&#8221; I was searching for &#8220;primary&#8221;. And voila, I found an event called <code>"SELECT_PRIMARY_COLOR"</code>. Sounds like exactly what I need. Now I needed to know how to trigger this event. So I was searching for where <code>"SELECT_PRIMARY_COLOR"</code> is used in the code and this is what I found:</p>



<p><code>$.publish(Events.SELECT_PRIMARY_COLOR, [color])</code></p>



<p>Nice, looks like I could just use something like <code>$.publish("SELECT_PRIMARY_COLOR", "#ff00ff")</code>. I tested it in the browser console and it worked! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I now also used the console to put the color input element to the HTML document and passed an event listener when the input is changed:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>const colorInput = 
  document.createElement("input")

colorInput.id = "lgkColorInput"
colorInput.className = "tool-icon"
colorInput.title = "Native color picker"
colorInput.type = "color"

// The tools container of Piskel's UI
document.getElementById("tools-container")
  .append(colorInput)

document.getElementById("lgkColorInput")
  .addEventListener(
    "input", 
    ({currentTarget}) =&gt; {
      $.publish("SELECT_PRIMARY_COLOR", 
      currentTarget.value)
    }
  )</code></pre>



<p>It looks great, like it was always part of the UI. I found the <code>"tool-icon"</code> class name, because all other tool buttons use it too.</p>



<p>Awesome, but everything I run on the browser console is just temporary, so I needed a way to always execute it when I&#8217;m on Piskel. The good thing; there is a browser extension for this: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/ddbjnfjiigjmcpcpkmhogomapikjbjdk/related" target="_blank">Custom</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/ddbjnfjiigjmcpcpkmhogomapikjbjdk/related" target="_blank">JavaScript for Websites 2</a><br>I installed it, pasted my code in and it works!</p>



<p>So if you would like to my new tool aswell, just install the extension and paste in my code and it should work. ^^</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> thanks to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220325035119/https://blog-static.lgk.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wayback Machine</a> I could also restore the latest posts, yay! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Probably the worst nightmare a blog maintainer could think of, happened to me. I deleted the database of this blog, by accident of course. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f921.png" alt="🤡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br>I actually was about to remove unused databases on my webspace, but looks like I deleted a wrong one. I didn&#8217;t even notice it myself, Felix by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hellocoding.de/" target="_blank">HelloCoding.de</a> told me my blog is not available (so thanks again for letting me know <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />).</p>



<p>Gladly I had a backup of the database. It&#8217;s from December 2021, so all the newer posts were gone. But I also had some posts on my local machine, so I could atleast import some of the newer posts. Because only the database got erased, all images and theme were still there. Some links to the images are still broken. I will fix them in the next days I guess. ^^ </p>

<p>It’s kinda a tradition for me to use my Christmas holidays for a fun little project. Since Svelte became more and more a thing, so I wanted to do try it in practice myself. I also heard that SvelteKit is pretty popular in the community, so I decided to is as a framework. Because I already knew Vercel from previous side projects, I was very happy that it is supporting deploying SvelteKit projects. Vercel is awesome, because you don’t have to care too much about publishing web apps. I just had to put my code on GitHub and connect it to Vercel. Each time when I push to the main branch, a new version will also be deployed automatically. Vercel also allows me to use my own sub-domain, so I could use&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://skip-it.lgk.io/" target="_blank">skip-it.lgk.io</a>. I also created my game as a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/" target="_blank">Progressive Web App (PWA)</a>, what makes it look and behave like an installable app, it even works offline!</p>

<figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption">How the looks the PWA on a phone. The app supports light and dark mode!</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can see it on the sub-domain, I later called my project “Skip it!” and it is a card game you can play anywhere. On your phone, on your computer and on your tablet. If you know the card game “Skip-Bo”, you could probably guess, how you can play my game. I chose to create a clone of Skip-Bo because I sometimes play it with my family and also enjoyed playing the iPad app a while ago. Through the iPad app I found out how addicting and fun the game can be and the game-play might be simple enough to create it with my skills in web technologies.</p>

<p>The developer experience using SvelteKit and Svelte was awesome! For years I primarily use React for my projects. I actually felt a little nostalgic, because I wrote actual HTML again, instead of JSX (no more&nbsp;<code>className</code>) and handling states is way more straightforward. I also use Svelte’s feature for scoped stylesheets. In previous projects I normally use SCSS and create global stylesheets. In Skip it! I switched to component-scoped architecture. Benefit is, you automatically just keep CSS, you will actually use, because the code-editor will underline unused CSS rules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Well, actually it’s already been a while since I launched this new design (October 2021 <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), but without any comment.</p>



<p>But I think it’s not too late to still write a little post about it.</p>



<h2>The goal: make the blog look like the rest of lgk.io</h2>



<p>The blog runs with WordPress and now with a new child theme of the preinstalled Twenty Twenty-One, I just called „Twenty Twenty-One LGK“. In the past I used a theme I totally created myself, it was called „Winegum“. It’s still available on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/lgkonline/Winegum1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/lgkonline/Winegum1</a>), but I really don’t recommend to use it anymore. It’s very outdated not compatible with modern WordPress features and third-party plugins. It might also be better for security reasons to use a theme, which is activity maintained. That’s why I switched to Twenty Twenty-One.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-08-um-15.38.48.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="680" src="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-08-um-15.38.48-1024x680.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2314" srcset="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-08-um-15.38.48-1024x680.png 1024w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-08-um-15.38.48-300x199.png 300w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-08-um-15.38.48-768x510.png 768w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-08-um-15.38.48-1536x1020.png 1536w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-08-um-15.38.48-2048x1360.png 2048w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-08-um-15.38.48-1568x1042.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Previous look with Twenty Twenty-One</figcaption></figure>



<p>I used the color customisation options of the theme to make it match better with my&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lgk.io/" target="_blank">portfolio site</a>. That was the first step to the current look of the blog. From there I created my child theme and replaced parts of the theme, most important part is the header.</p>



<p>By the way: my portfolio site and this blog are running on completely different technologies. The blog is a PHP-server-rendered WordPress site and my portfolio is a React Single-Page-Application. So my task was to bring the header of my React app to the WordPress theme and make it look as seamless as possible.</p>



<p>I’m pretty happy with the result. When you switch between „Blog“ and „Start“ for example, you are switching between two totally separated sites, hopefully without mentioning it. The blog uses the same colors and the same font now.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-09-um-07.56.48.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="608" src="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-09-um-07.56.48-1024x608.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2316" srcset="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-09-um-07.56.48-1024x608.png 1024w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-09-um-07.56.48-300x178.png 300w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-09-um-07.56.48-768x456.png 768w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-09-um-07.56.48-1536x912.png 1536w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-09-um-07.56.48-2048x1215.png 2048w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bildschirmfoto-2022-03-09-um-07.56.48-1568x931.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>This is how the blog looked like until I switched to Twenty Twenty-One</figcaption></figure>



<h2>The new search bar</h2>



<p>One thing was still missing on the new theme: a search bar. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f648.png" alt="🙈" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But hey, better late than never, right? It’s now there too!</p>

<p>This was actually a more difficult because I had to use some JavaScript here. I started coding the search bar on my portfolio and then brought it to the blog theme as a small React app only for the search bar. The search bar is just executing a simple WordPress search request (https://blog-static.lgk.io/?s=<strong>my+request</strong>). Right now, the request only shows results from my blog. It would be awesome, to also show results from my portfolio site. Maybe I will bring that in the future when I have time. ^^</p>

<p>With Photopea you can open, edit and save many different formats like .PSD, .AI, .XD and .sketch. Right in your browser, for free. So it might be perfect if Adobe’s subscription model is too expensive for you. With browsers like Chrome or Edge you can even install Photopea as a PWA on your desktop, so it will act like a native app. Then you even have direct access to files on your machine.</p>



<p>Because it’s free, you’ll see some ads on the side. If you want to remove it, you can spend a little money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Material Design, die Designsprache von Google, bekommt in Android 12 ein großes Update: Material You. Es gibt jetzt auch einen offiziellen Guide: <a href="https://m3.material.io/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://m3.material.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Material Design 3</a>.</p>



<p>Auf der Website bekommst du auch einen guten Eindruck, was sich geändert hat. Unter anderem neue Formen und neue Animationen.</p>



<p>Was ich am spannendsten finde: <a href="https://m3.material.io/styles/color/dynamic-color/user-generated-color" data-type="URL" data-id="https://m3.material.io/styles/color/dynamic-color/user-generated-color" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dynamische Farben</a>. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png"><img loading="lazy" width="676" height="800" src="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2310" srcset="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png 676w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed-254x300.png 254w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /></a><figcaption>Quelle: <a href="https://m3.material.io/styles/color/dynamic-color/user-generated-color" data-type="URL" data-id="https://m3.material.io/styles/color/dynamic-color/user-generated-color" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Material Design 3</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Google hat in Android 12 ein Algorithmus integriert, der Farbtöne aus dem Wallpaper der Nutzer:innen extrahiert, die vom UI verwendet werden können. So bekommen die Apps eine persönlichere Note.</p>



<p>Ich habe kein Android-Gerät, deswegen konnte ich das Feature noch nicht selbst ausprobieren. </p>



<h2>Umsetzung für Webseiten?</h2>



<p>Bisher ist Material You hauptsächlich für Android vorgesehen, es wird aber eine Frage der Zeit sein, dass auch an Web gedacht wird. Webseiten haben keine direkte Möglichkeit, den Wallpaper vom Betriebssystem abzugreifen.</p>



<p>Möglicherweise wird Google für Chrome die Theme-Farben als CSS-Variablen liefern, sodass Webentwickler:innen diese einfach nutzen können. Andere Chromium-Browser (wie Edge) könnten diese API dann ebenfalls erhalten.</p>



<h2>Übergangslösung</h2>



<p>Ich habe ein wenig experimentiert und Farben aus dem Standard-Wallpaper aus macOS Monterey mit Hilfe von <a href="https://color.adobe.com/de/create/color-contrast-analyzer" data-type="URL" data-id="https://color.adobe.com/de/create/color-contrast-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adobe Color</a> extrahiert.</p>



<figure class="wp-container-4 wp-block-gallery-3 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bildschirmfoto-2021-10-28-um-08.45.28.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="611" data-id="2327"  src="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bildschirmfoto-2021-10-28-um-08.45.28-1024x611.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2327" srcset="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bildschirmfoto-2021-10-28-um-08.45.28-1024x611.png 1024w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bildschirmfoto-2021-10-28-um-08.45.28-300x179.png 300w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bildschirmfoto-2021-10-28-um-08.45.28-768x458.png 768w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bildschirmfoto-2021-10-28-um-08.45.28-1536x916.png 1536w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bildschirmfoto-2021-10-28-um-08.45.28-2048x1222.png 2048w, https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bildschirmfoto-2021-10-28-um-08.45.28-1568x935.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>
</figure>



<p>Den Dark Mode habe ich ebenfalls berücksichtigt:</p>



<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/romantic-pasteur-2spki?fontsize=14&amp;hidenavigation=1&amp;module=%2Fstyle.css&amp;theme=dark" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" title="romantic-pasteur-2spki" allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"></iframe>



<p>In nächsten Schritten könnte man mit JavaScript herausfinden, welches Betriebssystem verwendet wird und jeweils Farben der Standard-Wallpaper anwenden. </p>



<p>Oder man erlaubt, Benutzer:innen ein Bild zum Analysieren hochzuladen/auszuwählen. Das halte ich allerdings für einen nicht sehr eleganten Ansatz. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Als Programmier:in entwickelt man mit der Zeit eine eigene Code-&#8220;Handschrift&#8221;. Benutzt du für Strings einfache Anführungszeichen (<code>'</code>) oder doppelte (<code>"</code>)? Benutzt du Semikolons? Benutzt du für Einrückungen Tabstopps oder Leerzeichen und wie viele?</p>



<p>Innerhalb eines Projekts ist es auf jeden Fall angenehm, überall die gleiche Formatierung zu haben. Das sorgt für eine bessere Übersicht und befriedigt nebenbei den inneren Monk. <br>Arbeitet man mit mehreren Personen an einem Projekt, kannst du entweder regelmäßig von Hand den Code der anderen formatieren oder du lässt es machen, automatisch!</p>



<h2>Installiere Prettier</h2>



<p>Das geht mit dem Tool <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://prettier.io/" target="_blank">Prettier</a>! Du legst zuvor in einer Config-Datei (.prettierrc.json) die Regeln fest (Semikolons ja/nein, maximale Zeilenlänge etc.) und führst dann Prettier aus. In einer separaten Datei (.prettierignore) kannst du noch definieren, welche Ordner und Dateien dabei unangetastet bleiben sollen.</p>



<p>Folge einfach dem offiziellen Guide, um Prettier bei dir einzurichten: <a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Install · Prettier</a></p>



<h2>Prettier bei jedem Git Commit ausführen</h2>



<p>Du kannst Prettier jedes Mal manuell ausführen oder dafür eine Extension in deinem Code-Editor installieren. Ich finde es allerdings angenehmer, dass Prettier automatisch vor jedem Git Commit ausgeführt wird. So wird sichergestellt, dass kein unschöner Code nach GitHub gelangt (oder wo auch immer du Git hostest). Auch funktioniert das ganze dann unabhängig davon, welchen Code-Editor du oder Team-Kolleg:innen verwenden. </p>



<p>Ich bin einfach den Abschnitt &#8220;Git hooks&#8221; gefolgt: <a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html#git-hooks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Install · Prettier</a></p>



<p>Das Tool &#8220;Husky&#8221; sorgt also dafür, dass Prettier vor jedem Git Commit-Befehl ausgeführt wird und der Code formatiert wird.</p>



<h2>Meine bevorzugten Einstellungen</h2>



<p>Meine .prettierrc.json-Datei sieht so aus:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>{
    "tabWidth": 4,
    "useTabs": false,
    "semi": false,
    "singleQuote": false,
    "trailingComma": "none",
    "bracketSpacing": true,
    "bracketSameLine": false,
    "fluid": false
}
</code></pre>



<ul><li>Zur Einrückung werden 4 Leerzeichen verwendet.</li><li>Ich nutze keine Semikolons (bei JavaScript und TypeScript).</li><li>Ich nutze doppelte Anführungszeichen bei Strings (<code>"</code>).</li><li>Keine Kommata, wo es nicht notwendig ist (z.B. in TypeScript Interfaces).</li><li>Leerzeichen um geschweifte Klammern (<code>{ foo: bar }</code>).</li><li>Für bracketSameLine siehe: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#bracket-line" target="_blank">https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#bracket-line</a></li></ul>



<p>Was du in .prettierignore reinschreibst, ist stark von deinem jeweiligem Projekt abhängig. Grundsätzlich sollte da alles rein, was kompiliert wird (vielleicht build-Ordner).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[About the code and workflow behind the new SP-Studio.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog_sp-studio-remake_itemoptions.jpg" alt="SP-Studio screenshot" class="wp-image-2149" width="500" height="500"/></figure></div>



<p>For some months I&#8217;m working on a cool project. It&#8217;s a web app where users can design their own characters in a South Park style. It&#8217;s the new modern version of the <a href="https://sp-studio.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SP-Studio</a>.</p>



<span id="more-2146"></span>



<p>The older version is already about 19 years old(!) and was running with Adobe Flash. Modern browsers stopped recommending using Flash already since many years, but technically still supported it. But at the end of 2020, Flash will be entirely shut down (R.I.P. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f622.png" alt="😢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />).</p>



<p>Honestly it&#8217;s been some years since I visited sp-studio.de the last time, but when I was younger, I was a big fan of it. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a big honor for me, to bring this cool project to a new life by developing this new modern version.</p>



<p>Not only doesn&#8217;t this new version depend on Flash anymore, it&#8217;s designed mobile-first and works on multiple platforms: smartphones, tables, laptops and desktops. It&#8217;s also a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/" target="_blank">Progressive Web App</a> (PWA for short). This means, you can visit it normally with your browser, but are also able to install it on your device, so it will act like an app.</p>



<p>To find out all other things that changed since the older version, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sp-studio.de/the-new-sp-studio/" target="_blank">please check out this post</a>. On this post, I want to write about the code and the technology behind this new version.</p>



<h2>Why React?</h2>



<p>I would say I&#8217;m already very experienced by using the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> library because I already use it for a while for different projects. Compared to them, SP-Studio is actually pretty simple and straightforward to code. For the project I don&#8217;t even need any other big libraries like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://reactrouter.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://reactrouter.com/" target="_blank">React Router</a>, since we don&#8217;t need different pages. I also don&#8217;t use complex state mangers like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://redux.js.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank">Redux</a>, I just work with props and states to let the different components talk to each other.</p>



<p>The project folder is generated with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://create-react-app.dev/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://create-react-app.dev/" target="_blank">create-react-app</a> (or &#8220;CRA&#8221; for short) and the TypeScript template. TypeScript forces me to work less chaotically, that&#8217;s why I love it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h2>Working with the SVG assets</h2>



<p>The most important task the app has to do, is to read the different assets the user should be able to add to its character. All assets are prepared by Janina as SVG files. And that&#8217;s another benefit from React, because it natively supports components in SVG format and can also manipulate its attributes with code.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><a href="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SP-Studio.png"><img src="https://blog-static.lgk.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SP-Studio.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2167"/></a><figcaption>The default body asset and its default color tones</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is how the SVG file of the default body asset looks like:</p>



<style type="text/css">
.wp-block-code {max-height: 500px;}
</style>

<p>Unfortunately I can&#8217;t directly use it like this for the application. It has to be formatted in a JSX format, also it needs to be a real React Component with props, so the values like colors can be changed from outside. That&#8217;s why wrote a script, which converts it to this:</p>

<p>But the script does do more than just to convert the asset to a React-friendly format. Actually this part is realized with the library <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@svgr/core" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@svgr/core" target="_blank">@svgr/core</a>.<br>My script extracts the primary color tones from the vector graphic and sets them as the default color options. These colors can be overwritten later by the user. The script does also do some more things to make it easier to work with the components from outside.</p>



<h2>Workflow with GitHub and Vercel</h2>

<p>I host and manage all my code repositories on GitHub, so I also do this one. GitHub is awesome for collaborating, and it&#8217;s easy for Janina to upload new assets. Even though the productive version wouldn&#8217;t be hosted there, we also use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vercel.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank">Vercel</a> to deploy and host states of the site for testing and debugging. Vercel works seamlessly together with GitHub and automatically deploys when I push new changes, so I can easily show them to Janina or to test them on different devices.</p>



<h2>That&#8217;s it</h2>



<p>for this article. If you would like to know more details about certain things or have any questions, let me know in the comments. </p>



<p>The final version of the app will be launched tomorrow as I write this, so check it out when it&#8217;s published: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sp-studio.de/" target="_blank">https://sp-studio.de/</a></p>



<p>The app will evolve with the time. We plan to publish a big update with more features early 2021. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f607.png" alt="😇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
