<p>It‚Äôs kinda a tradition for me to use my Christmas holidays for a fun little project. Since Svelte became more and more a thing, so I wanted to do try it in practice myself. I also heard that SvelteKit is pretty popular in the community, so I decided to is as a framework. Because I already knew Vercel from previous side projects, I was very happy that it is supporting deploying SvelteKit projects. Vercel is awesome, because you don‚Äôt have to care too much about publishing web apps. I just had to put my code on GitHub and connect it to Vercel. Each time when I push to the main branch, a new version will also be deployed automatically. Vercel also allows me to use my own sub-domain, so I could use&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://skip-it.lgk.io/" target="_blank">skip-it.lgk.io</a>. I also created my game as a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/" target="_blank">Progressive Web App (PWA)</a>, what makes it look and behave like an installable app, it even works offline!</p>

<p>You can see it on the sub-domain, I later called my project ‚ÄúSkip it!‚Äù and it is a card game you can play anywhere. On your phone, on your computer and on your tablet. If you know the card game ‚ÄúSkip-Bo‚Äù, you could probably guess, how you can play my game. I chose to create a clone of Skip-Bo because I sometimes play it with my family and also enjoyed playing the iPad app a while ago. Through the iPad app I found out how addicting and fun the game can be and the game-play might be simple enough to create it with my skills in web technologies.</p>

<p>The developer experience using SvelteKit and Svelte was awesome! For years I primarily use React for my projects. I actually felt a little nostalgic, because I wrote actual HTML again, instead of JSX (no more&nbsp;<code>className</code>) and handling states is way more straightforward. I also use Svelte‚Äôs feature for scoped stylesheets. In previous projects I normally use SCSS and create global stylesheets. In Skip it! I switched to component-scoped architecture. Benefit is, you automatically just keep CSS, you will actually use, because the code-editor will underline unused CSS rules.</p>

<p>Right now you can play against 3 players. I also thought about if you could play against real players.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/solutions/realtime" target="_blank">There are multiple ways to realise such realtime actions</a>. Maybe I will implement it next holidays. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="üòÖ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
